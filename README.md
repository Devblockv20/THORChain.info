The Blockchain Explorer is a React App with an API that serves metrics from a local database that is polled from the blockchain. 

It has four main components:

1) Polling information from Blockchain (via tendermint RPC)
2) Storing locally in a database
3) Serving information for metrics via an API
4) Displaying on the React App


This project contains both the api and gui of the explorer.
